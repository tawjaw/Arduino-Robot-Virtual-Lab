<h1 class="mt-4">Challenge!</h1>
<p>In previous lab activities you practiced basic skills for programming and manipulating
  the robot using the servos and feedback from the ultrasonic sensor. The original in-class challenge was
  to navigate along a wall, perform a turn, navigate along a second wall and pass through a gate as shown below. </p>

</p>

<p>You were constrained to keep the servo-powered wheels from touching a tape line and challenged to perform
  the task in the fastest possible time, competing with other teams in the class. Now, in the virtual environment,
  we are giving you a nearly equivalent challenge to the original.
  To prepare you were to develop and test a <a href="followwall.hbs">Follow the Wall</a> strategy. Employ a similar
  strategy
  to the more complex navigation challenge given.</p>

<p><em><b>Note</b>: Your final solution should not use a hard-coded strategy. You should be able to modify your code
    for a challenge with different coin distances from the walls. You will be assessed on completion of the task as well
    as
    the strategy you employed.</em></p>

  <h4 class="alert-heading">Instructions</h4>

  <p>The coins are approximately 110 cm away from the top wall and approximately 70 cm from the right wall.
    Use the data from the ultrasonic sensor to navigate the robot to collect all coins. </p>
  <div class="text-center">

      <a class="btn btn-primary " style="width: 200px; font-size: 30px;   line-height: 40px;
    " data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample" role="button" aria-expanded="false"

    </p>
    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample" style="max-width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
      <div class="card card-body">
        Start with a strategy that allows you to follow the wall at any distance that you specify. Then after following
        the
        top wall at the distance that gets you all the coins, rotate to the next wall and change the distance you want
        to
        be away from that wall using the same strategy.
