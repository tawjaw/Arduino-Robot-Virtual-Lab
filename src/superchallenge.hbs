<h1 class="mt-4">Super Challenge!</h1>
<p>In the previous challenge you were able to use the feedback from the ultrasonic sensor to navigate through the environment and collect the coins. However, most of you hardcoded some parts of your strategy, especially when rotating from the top wall to the right wall. </p>

<p>
  In this challenge, we still have the same requirments with one small change to the environment. Every time the coins are collected, the top wall shifts to the left or the right and chaning the distance of the gap between the two walls. When all the coins are collected, the robot will automatically reset its position. 
</p>


<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"
  style="max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; margin-top:50px;">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Instructions</h4>

  <p>Design an algorithm that iterates at least 3 times through this environment, collecting all coins at every iteration. Your strategy should generalize an approach to rotate from the top wall to right wall regardless of the distance of the gap between both walls. </p>
